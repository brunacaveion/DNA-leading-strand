# DNA-leading-strand
The code named leading-strand.ipynb is a way to find the leading strand of a bacterial DNA strand, using the DNA's probability matrix. 

The other code named ML-model-leading-strand.ipynb has a few classification Machine Learning models to test if it is possible to predict each chirochore is the leading one though the probability matrix of bacterial DNA.
